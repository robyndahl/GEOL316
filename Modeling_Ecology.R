# Modeling Ecological Gradients

Modeling ecological gradients using multivariate data analyses.

## Basic Concepts

Most traditional data analyses are **univariate** or **bivariate**. A univariate analysis assesses a single variable and a bivariate analysis compares two variables. For example, `hist( )` is a univariate analysis, a `t.test( )` is bivariate, and a scatter plot is bivariate.

Such analyses fall shore when you want to anlyze the relationships among many different variables, i.e, a **multivariate** dataset. In fact, there are a whole host of problems associated with applying multiple bivariate anlyses to a multivariate dataset. In other words, you can't just perform a bivariate analysis on every possible pair of combinations in a multivariate dataset.

One way to solve this issue to use **multivariate** analyses. In this lab, we are going to explore a broad class of multivariate analyses known as **ordinations**. The driving principle behind these methods is to "*reduce the dimensionality*" of a multivariate dataset. In other words, we will take a dataset with many variables and summaries their relationships with only a few of those variables.
