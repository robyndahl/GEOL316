# Geometric Morphometrics

## Part 1: Introduction

In this week’s lab, we will be learning about ***geometric morphometrics***, a method of studying organismal shape. Webster & Sheets (2010) provide an excellent introduction to the study and its utility within the field of paleontology. In their intro, they explain:

>Morphometrics is the quantitative study of biological shape, shape variation, and covariation of shape with other biotic or abiotic variables or factors. Such quantification introduces much-needed rigor into the description of and comparison between morphologies. Application of morphometric techniques therefore benefits any research field that depends upon comparative morphology: this includes systematics and evolutionary biology, biostratigraphy, and developmental biology (including studies of growth patterns within species, modularity, and evolutionary patterns such as heterochrony, etc.)
>
>Three general styles of morphometrics are often recognized, distinguished by the nature of data being analyzed. Traditional morphometrics involves summarizing morphology in terms of length measurements, ratios, or angles, that can be investigated individually (univariate analyses) or several at a time (bivariate and multivariate analyses). Landmark-based geometric morphometrics involves summarizing shape in terms of a landmark configuration (a constellation of discrete anatomical loci, each described by 2- or 3-dimensional Cartestian coordinates), and is inherently multidimensional. Outline-based geometric morphometrics involves summarizing the shape of open or closed curves (perimeters), typically without fixed landmarks.
>
>Geometric morphometrics (both landmark-based and outline) is powerful and popular because information regarding the spatial relationship among landmarks on the organism is contained within the data. This gives the ability to draw evocative diagrams of morphological transformations or differences, offering an immediate visualization of shape and the spatial localization of shape variation. Such graphical representation is easier to intuitively understand than a table of numbers.

### Learning Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to collect 2D landmark data from photographs, how to conduct geometric morphometric analyes on those landmark data, and how to interpret your results. Our study organism for this lab will be trilobites and all of our data will be collected from photographs compiled by Serra et al. (2023) for [Trilomorph](https://github.com/balsedie/trilomorph), an open-access database for trilobite morphometrics.
