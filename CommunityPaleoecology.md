# Community Paleoecology

The first part of this lab should be completed on the worksheet handed out in class.

## Part 2: Introduction to R

In Part 1 of this lab, you calculated the dissimilarity scores for four hypothetical assemblages by hand. Paleontologists rarely do such calculations by hand, especially when working with large data sets. From this point forward, we will use the R programming language to conduct our analyses.

Since we don't have time to actually learn to program in R, I will be providing you with the scripts you should use to analyze our datasets. If you are interested in actually learning how to write code in R, I can direct you towards some very useful tutorials to explore on your own time.

### Step 1: R Studio
We will be using the R Studio programming environment for this lab. R Studio is free download and is also available on all campus computers, including the machines in the Geology Department computer lab in ES 230. If you need extra time to complete this lab, you can either download the program onto your own computer or find a computer on campus to use.

You can download R Studio [here](https://posit.co/downloads/).
